# Avatar - The Last Airbender

- **This is a Project I used to train my abilities in using the VueJS 3 Framework with its different powers and magics.**

- **The source of this idea comes from FrontendMasters, where I attended the "Vue 3 Fundamentals" Course which was really good in showing me the great opportunities that Vue has to offer.**

- **Though doing this Project while attending this course I did my best to customize it as much as I could and implemented different features that would not be shown in this fundamentals course**

**By the time doing this Project I was more involved into building Webapps with React. But Vue is definitely a wonderful Framework and I think that switching over on the long term might not be a surprise for me after all.**
